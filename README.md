# PhysicianDirectory
Beginning the project
Developing a directory for physicians to ensure accurate referral and updated contact information for patients. Intitial design to have ASCI information with eventual objective to have logos and specific brand incorporated.

It needs to have a searchable and selectable list that when published via POST will return a formatted page that can be handed to a patient.
